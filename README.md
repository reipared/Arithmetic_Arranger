# Arithmetic Arranger

The "arithmetic_arranger" function is designed to arrange and solve arithmetic problems in a vertical format.

The function takes a list of arithmetic problems as input and arranges them vertically, aligning the operands and the operator. It supports addition and subtraction operations.

The function includes error handling for various scenarios. It checks if there are too many problems (more than 5), if the operator is valid (must be '+' or '-'), and if the operands contain only digits. It also verifies that the operands have a maximum of four digits.

The function can optionally show the computed answers for each problem if the "show_answer" parameter is set to True.

The arranged problems are combined into a single string, with proper spacing and formatting, and returned as the output.

Example usage and output are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the "arithmetic_arranger" function.
